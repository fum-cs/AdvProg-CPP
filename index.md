# Advanced Programming Course with C++

Welcome to the advanced programming course which is devoted to C++ for Python programmers.

This course consists of several chapters, each covering a specific topic or feature of C++. Each chapter contains a lot of code examples and exercises to help you understand and practice the concepts. You can find the source code on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fum-cs/cpp4python/) of this course (TO-DO). I hope you enjoy this course and learn a lot from it.

I should also mention that the original material of this course was from [Jan Pearce, Berea College and Brad Miller, Runestone](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/cpp4python/index.html). I have forked the [related repository](https://github.com/pearcej/cpp4python), convert rst files to markdown, and I am modifying it to suit my own needs and preferences. I would like to thank them for her great work and generosity.
